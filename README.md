# Django-Angular-Base

This provides a good base for a standalone Django application using AngularJS
as the driving application force. It provides a server configuration, log
collection, and uses an internal Django-Rest-Framework API which is consumed
in AngularJS. An authentication system and custom user model is provided which
can be extended for personal use.
